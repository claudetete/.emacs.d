;;; Commentary:
;;
;; load by init.el
;;
;; be careful it is the last loaded file, so everything emacs put in will
;; overwrite your other settings (to be sure I always empty this file.)


;;; Code:
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
  )

(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.

(provide 'tqnr-custom)

;; tqnr-custom.el ends here
